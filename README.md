## Technical Notes

### Google Classroom Scraping
- Uses Selenium with visible Chrome (headless mode blocked by Google)
- Extracts assignments from "Assigned", "Missing", and "Done" tabs
- Handles dynamic content expansion and filtering
- Supports multiple account management

### Jupiter Ed Scraping  
- Parent portal login with student name + password
- Class-based assignment discovery
- Handles assignment details extraction
- Automatic missing assignment detection based on due dates

### Data Format
```json
{
  "assigned": [
    {
      "name": "Assignment Name",
      "class": "Course Name", 
      "due_date": "October 20, 2025",
      "due_date_parsed": "2025-10-20",
      "url": "https://...",
      "description": "Assignment description",
      "max_points": 100
    }
  ],
  "missing": [...],
