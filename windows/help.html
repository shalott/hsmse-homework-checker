                This is NOT a professional app - it's just a tool that one parent is sharing to hopefully help others out. This tool is provided as-is with no guarantees. Use at your own risk!

                This app simulates logging in and looking for all missing and upcoming assignments across various HSMSE accounts (Google Classroom, Jupiter Ed, etc.).

                <ul class="limitations-list">
                    <li>This is an inherently brittle process that WILL break for all sorts of reasons</li>
                    <li>It can and probably will miss some assignments and get details wrong</li>
                    <li>If any of the sites are down, updates will fail</li>
                    <li>If a teacher changes where they are posting assignments, they may not be found</li>
                    <li>The app is UNSIGNED and your operating system will make you jump through security hoops to install it</li>
                    <li>I can't help if you run into problems!</li>

                    <li>You will be asked for your Jupiter credentials and to choose which classes to load from Jupiter Ed. Choose the classes that are primarily updated on Jupiter -- if you include classes that are primarily updated on 
                        Google Classroom, you may end up with duplicate assignments.</li>
                    <li>You will be asked to log in to an @nycstudents.net account for the NYC Students Google Classroom</li>
                    <li>You will then be asked to add on your @hsmse.org account for the HSMSE Google Classroom</li>
